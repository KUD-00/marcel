Syntax:

    - Replace > by ~
    - Have > work more conventionally, as syntactic sugar for out -f.

PROBLEM: Lexer sees ~ and assumes it's a TILDE, even here:

    ls ~/foo*

Can't rely on / to disambiguate, e.g.

    ls ~ 

Disambiguating:

- ~ adjacent to string: Concatenate, the ~ is part of the string. (adjacent: touching)

- ~ followed by EOL: String

- ~ followed by |: String

- ~ followed by string: TILDE

  But

      ls ~ abc

  is ambiguous. Could mean list this directory and abc, or redirect ls contents to abc.

~ is just a bad choice for redirection.

Alternatives:

        ls ~> v
        ls ~>> v

        ls ~~ v
        ???

        
What about using ~~ for append? Delete the variable to start over. But
replacing var's value is probably the most common usage, so that gets
clunky -- have to delete and then store.

Fixing this:

       ls ~~ v       # overwrite
       ls ~~+ v      # append



     ls . v
     ls .. v
     v . select (...)

No, same problem as ~, overloaded.


ls > ./files.txt

./files.txt > out

./files.txt > ./files2.txt

> and >> are very much like ~~ and ~~+. 

Minor issue: Still not happy with the syntax. Ideally the latter
symbols would be ~ and ~~, but ~ can't be disambiguated (see above).

Bigger issue: 

- > is for text, like Linux, writing strings to a file. ~~ is for
streams, pickling the whole thing. So the difference between > and ~~
is really about format, text vs. pickling.

- ~~ works on vars or files, while > works just on files. 

- read has options for text (default), csv, tsv, pickle. out has
  options for csv, pickle.

Could regularize all of this:

- Have one set of redirection symbols, > and >>.

- Somehow indicate format (text stream, csv, tsv, pickle stream). Perhaps a format
  operator? But then what should the default be?

- Support reading from/writing to files or vars.

Example:

    gen 3 ~~ x
    x ~~

This has to know to write a pickled result to the var x, and then
unpickle. This formatting info is current implicit in the ~~ syntax.

And here:

    gen 3 > ./file.txt
    ./file.txt >

implies text stream.

What about this:

- Default is pickling for vars, text stream for files.

- format operator for when the defaults are not what's wanted.

But what about this:

    gen 3 > x
    x > ./file.txt

x is a var, so we assume pickling. ./file.txt is a file so we assume
text stream. The conversion is implied. Equivalent to (inventing some
flags):

    load --pickle x | out --text ./file.txt

Along these lines, and to clean things up, read/out, load/store should
be unified.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Design, first attempt:

- Combine load and read -> in

- read has args for a few different purposes:

  - File traversal: -0, -1, --recursive
  - Format: --csv, --tsv, --pickle
  - Output: --label
  - filenames

  The format flags can be applied to vars also.

- Combine store and out -> out

- out (current version) has args for a few different purposes:

  - Target: stdout or file. File is implied by use of --append or
    --file flags, which must be followed by a filename arg.

  - Format: --csv, --pickle, FORMAT. If none of these are provided, do
    default rendering.

  Keep the format flags, and add --tsv. 

Var or file?

- var is a python identifier.

- file must begin with ., ~, or /. Could do more complex inference,
  e.g. file.txt is a file because . is not valid in a python
  identifier. But keep it simple. file.txt is not valid as either a
  var or a file. ./file.txt is a file.

- in VAR:

  - One var, no wildcards.
  - format flag

- in FILE:

  - Multiple filenames, wildcards, start with ., ~, or /.
  - format flag
  - traversal flags

- out (no filename or var)

  - write to stdout
  - format

- out VAR:

  - format. Maybe require --format flag. 
  - target

- out FILE:

  - format
  - target

Syntactic sugar:

    Syntax              Meaning

    ... > var           ... | out --pickle var


    ... > ./file        ... | out --text --file ./file

    var > ...           in --pickle var | ...

    ./file > ...        in --text --file ./file | ...

{L,wrap=F}in [[-01] [-r|--recursive]] [-c|--csv] [-t|--tsv] [-p|--pickle] [-l|--label] [NAME ...]
NAME >

{L,indent=4:28}{r:-0}                      Include only files matching the specified NAMEs, (i.e., depth 0).

{L,indent=4:28}{r:-1}                      Include files matching the specified NAMEs, and in any directories
among the NAMEs, (i.e., depth 1).

{L,indent=4:28}{r:-r}, {r:--recursive}         Include all files contained in the identified NAMEs, recursively,
to any depth.

{L,indent=4:28}{r:-c}, {r:--csv}               Parse CSV-formatted lines with comma separator.

{L,indent=4:28}{r:-t}, {r:--tsv}               Parse CSV-formatted lines with tab separator.

{L,indent=4:28}{r:-p}, {r:--pickle}            Parse pickle format

{L,indent=4:28}{r:-l}, {r:--label}             Include the input {n:File} in the output.

{L,indent=4:28}{r:NAME}                A variable, filename or glob pattern.

Tuples from a source are written to the output stream. The source can
be a variable, or one or more files. In the latter case, files can be
specified by giving their names, or glob patterns (the {r:NAME}
arguments). Alternatively, files can be piped in from an upstream
command, typically {r:ls}. In the latter case, input tuples are
assumed to be 1-tuples containing {n:File}s.

Each file is read, and each line is written to the output stream, with
end-of-line characters ({r:\\\\r}, {r:\\\\n}) removed.

The formatting options ({r:--csv}, {r:--tsv}, {r:--pickle}) may only
be used when reading from files. These options are mutually exclusive.

If {r:--csv} is specified, then input lines are assumed to be in the
CSV format, using a comma. The line is parsed, and a tuple of fields
is output. Similarly, if {r:--tsv} is specified, input lines are
assumed to be in the CSV format with a tab separator.  {r:--pickle}
parses the input for the Python pickle format.


If the input is from {r:File}s, and {r:--label} is specified, then the
input {n:File} is included in the output, in the first position of
each output tuple, (i.e., each line is labelled with the {r:File} it
came from).
{r:--label} cannot be used for other sources.

There is special syntax for the {n:in} operator:

{L,indent=4,wrap=F}in NAME | ...

can be written as

{L,indent=4,wrap=F}NAME > ...

The syntax is designed to be reminiscent of bash behavior for files,
but it accomodates variables as well.
